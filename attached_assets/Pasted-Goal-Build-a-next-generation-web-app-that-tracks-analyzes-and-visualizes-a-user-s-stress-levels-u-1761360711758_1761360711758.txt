Goal:
Build a next-generation web app that tracks, analyzes, and visualizes a user’s stress levels using web-accessible data and Gemini API intelligence.

The app combines:

Google Fit data (steps, sleep, heart rate)

Web activity patterns (screen time, site focus, social vs productive)

Self-reported mood and text-based reflection

AI insights (Gemini) to analyze stress and give recommendations
